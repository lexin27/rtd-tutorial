"This" is my example-script

This example doesn't do much, it just makes a simple plot

This is a section header
------------------------

In the built documentation, it will be rendered as reST. All reST lines
must begin with '# ' (note the space) including underlines below section
headers.

    # These lines won't be rendered as reST because there is a gap after the last
    # commented reST block. Instead, they'll resolve as regular Python comments.
    # Normal Python code can follow these comments.
    print('my variable plus 2 is {}'.format(myvariable + 2))
